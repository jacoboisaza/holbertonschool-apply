# Static Site for Holberton School application process

## My Goal
I want to learn something new every day solving real problems with nice people and create good software.
Create software is less difficult when you meet the right mentor.

## Why Holberton
Because it looks like they have a good education model that could work for me, instead of the ancient/obsolete university education models in my city (medellin - Colombia)

## Contributions
My code for this application is open to all your recommendations.
